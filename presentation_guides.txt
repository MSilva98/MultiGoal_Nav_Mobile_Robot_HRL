1. Introduction and Problem
    robot and environment used
    robot navigation is complex
    multi-goal makes more sense than single goal

2. Hierarchical Approach
    hierarchy makes things easier
        - turns 1 complext into many simple
    present hierarchy used

2. Low-Level Implementation
    present each task and robot performance
    present environments used
    show video going randomly

3. High-Level Implementation
    present what high level controls
    present environments used
    what else?

4. Dynamic Behaviour
    explain how it is done
        - present video of robot doing it

5. Multi-Goal
    explain algorithm done
        - present results of robot (environment going between multiple goals with and without 180ยบ)

6. Conclusions
    final remarks on what has been done
